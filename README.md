Responsive Wordpress Base Theme based off Bones, Foundation (+ more)

Girders is designed to make the life of developers easier. It is
built using HTML5 & has a strong semantic foundation. It is developed
with the goal of providing a starting point for every responsive
WordPress theme that we build.

This theme is based on Scaffolding.io, but with Bootstrap removed.
